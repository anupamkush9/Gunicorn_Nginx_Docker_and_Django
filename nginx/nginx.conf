# The upstream directive allows you to define a group of servers that can handle the incoming requests.
# Here, django_app is the name given to the upstream server group
# The proxy_pass directive inside the location / block uses the django_app upstream server to proxy the requests to the Django application server. 
# This way, Nginx acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests from clients to the Django application server.
# By using the upstream server group, you can easily scale your Django application by adding more servers to the upstream group. Nginx will then distribute the requests among the available servers.
